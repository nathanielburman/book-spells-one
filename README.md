Notes: When the evil pieces of shit from my hometown tortured me when I was 20 I thought the Fairy woman (Elanor) was a Sun Goddess because she had red hair. Alinor here I also thought has red hair however. Alinor Darla here, Alinor becomes a title, however all of these ‘goddesses’ or witches are evil to me and have always been evil to me.

Note: There is a lie on #2, it is the opposite.	111
Careful, carefully care for me

Note: Angels are evil. I have met male angels that were pure evil. I have met female angels that were amazing. Angels do have sexual organs now, if they were absent before or for some time during our collective history, they have developed sexual organs again. ‘Angels’ are succubi and incubi.	113
